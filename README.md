# FACE-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM-USING-PRINCIPAL-COMPONENT-ANALYSIS
This project mainly addresses the building of face recognition system by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical approach used for reducing the number of variables in face recognition. In PCA, every image in the training set is represented as a linear combination of weighted eigenvectors called eigenfaces. These eigenvectors are obtained from covariance matrix of a training image set. The weights are found out after selecting a set of most relevant Eigenfaces. Recognition is performed by projecting a test image onto the subspace spanned by the eigenfaces and then classification is done by measuring minimum Euclidean distance.
